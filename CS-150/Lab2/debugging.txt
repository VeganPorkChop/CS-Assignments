punctuation.py
--> The if statement was only occuring when the character WAS a punctiuation, not when it wasnt.

optimize.py
--> When concattenating the rest of the DNA guess onto the attempt, the coder forgot to keep the guess in the string.
--> What ended up happening was that the attempt would just turn into whatever the string was from current position to the end of the starting string

evaluate.py
--> You forgot to do the last evaluation. Because of how the loop worked, the loop would end before the last number was
--> calculated into total.
